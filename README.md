 This is an app build in Swift, with viewCode. It will have a loginScreen with Firebase integration for database.
 It will use Cocoapods for dependency and MVVM architecture design. I will bring some new features in the future to apply my new knowledgement.
 This project will be using a clean git history and best practices.
 
 Pictures and demo will be provided in the future.
